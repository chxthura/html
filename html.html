<p align=justify><s> Yunalis</s> Mat Zara'ai, professionally known as Yuna, is a Malaysian singer-songwriter and businesswoman.
 <div style="color:red; text-align:right;">Born and raised in Kedah and Selangor, she began writing songs at age 14.
</div>She soon taught herself to play guitar, and by 2006, in need of a creative outlet while attending law school, performed for an audience for the first time. 
<tt>Yuna offered her music on her MySpace page, which received over one million plays. 
</tt>This online success tipped off the Indie-Pop label/management company to her music, and in early 2011 she signed with the Fader label.
Joined by guitarist Pa'an, bassist Efry Arwis, and drummer Adib Azfar (and later, Adil Ali),

<var>She took home four trophies,</var> including Best New Artist and Best Song (for the breakout hit "Dan Sebenarnya").
